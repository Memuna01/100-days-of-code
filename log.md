100 Days of code

Day 0: January 4th, 2017

- Today's progress: i decided to start a simple calculator app.

- Thoughts: I'm having problems linking my bootstrap to my html page, which is suprising and annoying. i've had to resort to a CDN so i don't get stuck. I'm also trying to create the UI. it's a big problem for me.

- Link to work: errr, no link for now.

Day 1: January 5th, 2017

- Today's progress: Continued my calculator app on codepen.io(love it!) instead of my localhost.

- Thoughts: I abandoned bootstrap completely and stuck with ol' CSS. Still have to add more styling to the calculator though.

Day 2: January 6th, 2017

- Today's progress: tried to add more styles to my calculator. Trying to figure out how to make tables (more?) mobile responsive.

- Thoughts: I'm not sure what project to do next. A text editor maybe?

- Today's progress: i've missed two days now. i just decided to learn more about Node.js

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
